# Contribution Guidelines

We want to start off by saying thank you for using Jvm-Brotli. This project is a labour of love, and we appreciate all users who spend their precious time making contributions, regardless of experience level.
 
Whether it's reporting/fixing bugs, making performance improvements, helping with documentation, or even implementing a whole new feature, every contribution is meaningful and adds to the overall quality of the project. Thank you very much for your interest in participating!
 
We don't expect you to read a huge wall of text or adhere to any strict set of rules when making a contribution. Our only requirement is that you follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/nixxcode/jvm-brotli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which exists to keep the Jvm-Brotli community a kind and welcoming place for everybody who wishes to participate.

**There is no experience requirement!** Even if you are completely new to open source and have never made a contribution before, please don't let that discourage you! Every single one of us has been there. You have to start somewhere, and it might as well be with us. :smile:

We will respond to **every** contribution, regardless if we choose to accept it or not. In the event your contribution is not accepted, we will offer an explanation, and where possible, give you the opportunity to make the needed corrections yourself.

With all that said, here are a few brief guidelines, just to keep things clear for everybody involved:

- If you are reporting a bug, please open an issue, explain the problem and provide the steps to reproduce it.

- If you are requesting a new feature, please open an issue, describe the feature, and provide your reasoning as to why you feel it would be a good addition to Jvm-Brotli.

- If you are contributing a fix (typo, bugfix, etc.), you don't need to ask. Feel free to just fork Jvm-Brotli, make the correction and open a pull request with a brief explanation for the fix.

- If you are looking to add a brand new feature, or otherwise make a significant change to Jvm-Brotli, please open an issue where the proposed change can be discussed and reviewed by the community in order to determine whether or not it fits in with the project's vision.

For anything not in the list, please feel free to open an issue and ask! 

If you've gotten this far, we would once again like to thank you for your interest. If you do have a contribution in mind, **please** open an issue and share it with us!
